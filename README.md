# OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial
**C++ Version of the ThinMatrix OpenGL Tutorial**

I am trying to learn C++ with OpenGL so I decided to convert the ThinMatrix tutorial series into C++.

If you have any constructive criticism or changes in code that would make this better I encourage it.

After you compile make sure you copy the .dll files in the lib folder to the folder that contains your .exe file.

External libraries I'll be using are:
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

This is the [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix) youtube channel.

[thebennybox](https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox) also has good tutorials. Many of these tutorials were used to convert this to C++.

[Jamie King](https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja) also used some of this guys tutorials. For example, the FPS camera.

[http://www.learnopengl.com/](http://www.learnopengl.com/) another amazing resource.
