# OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial
C++ Version of the ThinMatrix OpenGL Tutorial

I am trying to learn C++ with OpenGL so I decided to convert the ThinMatrix tutorial series into C++.

If you have any constructive criticism or changes in code that would make this better I encourage it.

Keep in mind that I am learning C++ so there might be code that should be different. But, it does compile and work.

You can find ThinMatrix here https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix

Another very useful channel is thebennybox found here https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox
I have used a lot of his tutorials to convert this tutorial series to C++
